## intimacy-vs-friendship-balancer

### Overview

The "Intimacy vs. Friendship Balancer" is a web tool designed to help users visually allocate their values between deep, meaningful friendships and sexually satisfying experiences. By interacting with a grid, users can explore how they prioritize these aspects of their lives.

### Goal

The goal of this tool is to provide an intuitive and visually engaging way for users to reflect on and balance their values between two important aspects of human relationships: friendships and intimate experiences. By visualizing these priorities, users can gain insights into their own preferences and make more informed decisions about their social and personal lives.

### Rules

- Users can input integer values into each square of the grid, with the total value across all squares not exceeding 25.
- Negative values are not allowed.

### Axes

- **X-axis:** Number of Deep, Meaningful Friendships
- **Y-axis:** Ease of Access to Sexually Satisfying Experiences
