## Prompt Specification

This prompt specification is designed to be all that is needed to write the code for the "Intimacy vs. Friendship Balancer" project.

### Project Goal

Create an HTML webpage featuring a centered grid of input squares. The tool allows users to distribute values between deep, meaningful friendships and sexually satisfying experiences, with specific constraints and dynamic color coding.

### Detailed Specifications

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Total value of all squares cannot exceed 25.
   - No square can have a negative value.
   - Only integer values are allowed.
   - Users should be able to enter the number directly or use plus and minus buttons found inside each square to adjust the value by one.
   - If the user tries to enter an invalid value, the change should not be allowed. A small red box should pop up explaining the issue, and a red border should briefly appear around the affected square.

2. **Dynamic Color Coding:**
   - Squares with higher values should appear greener.
   - Squares with lower values should appear redder.
   - Colors should update in real-time as the user enters values.
   - Implement a visually appealing color gradient between red (lowest values) and green (highest values).

3. **Grid Labels:**
   - X-axis labels (bottom): "Almost None", "Few", "Many"
   - Y-axis labels (left): "Almost None", "Few", "Many"
   - X-axis description (bottom): "Number of Deep, Meaningful Friendships"
   - Y-axis description (left): "Ease of Access to Sexually Satisfying Experiences"
   - Labels should be aligned with the individual squares.

4. **Design Requirements:**
   - The webpage should look very modern and professional.
   - Use a visually appealing and modern font.
   - Ensure the grid is centered on the webpage.
   - The grid should contain individual squares for user input.
   - Include a description at the top of the page explaining the purpose of the tool.
   - The design should be optimized for dark mode.
   - Fully compatible with smartphones as well as desktops.

5. **Real-time Feedback:**
   - Display the number of points remaining in real-time as the user inputs values. This can be done via a counter displayed prominently above or below the grid.

6. **Additional Details:**
   - The interface should be intuitive and user-friendly.
